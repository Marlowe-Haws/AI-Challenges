# Create a function that utilizes a dictionary comprehension to take in a string input and return a dictionary that lists each word
# as the key, with the number of occurrences of that word within the text as the value.
# Difficulty easy-intermediate

# My solution:

def word_freq(text):
    clean_text = ""
    for char in text:
        if char.isalpha() or char == " ":
            clean_text += char
    words = clean_text.strip().lower().split()
    unique_words = set(words)
    word_frequencies = {word: words.count(word) for word in unique_words}
    return word_frequencies

# AI's optimized version:

from collections import Counter
def word_freq(text):
    clean_text = "".join(c.lower() for c in text if c.isalpha() or c==" ")
    words = clean_text.strip().split()
    return dict(Counter(words))
