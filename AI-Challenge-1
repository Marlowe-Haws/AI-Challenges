# Write a function that will take a list of song names, sometimes with brackets in titles such as '[Live]', and various casings,
# and return a list that removes anything between brackets and makes all letters lowercase. For empty items, return empty items.
# Easy difficulty.

# My solution
def clean_phrase(phrase):
    cleaned_phrase = []
    for item in phrase:
        new_item = re.sub(r"\[.*?\]", '', item).strip().lower()
        cleaned_phrase.append(new_item)
    return cleaned_phrase

# Example test: print(clean_phrase(["Bohemian Rhapsody[live]","-STAIRWAY-to-heaven",""]))
# Should return: ['bohemian rhapsody', '-stairway-to-heaven', '']
